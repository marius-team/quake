Development Guide
=======================

Quake is a high‑performance vector search engine written in C++ with Python bindings. It supports adaptive, real‑time updates and query‑adaptive search—letting you specify a recall target so that the index automatically adjusts its search scope. This guide will help you rapidly understand our design, coding standards and contribution workflow.

Codebase Overview
----------------------------
Quake’s design is split into two major layers:

1. **The C++ Core**
   Implements the heavy‑lifting: index construction, query processing, vector updates, and dynamic maintenance (splits, merges, and reassignments). It is organized in the ``src/cpp/`` directory. Key components include:

   - **QuakeIndex:**
     The central class that coordinates building, searching, and maintaining the index.
   - **PartitionManager:**
     Manages dynamic partitions (or “clusters”) of vectors.
   - **MaintenancePolicy:**
     Encapsulates the rules for when and how to split or merge partitions to meet recall targets.
   - **QueryCoordinator:**
     Distributes search queries across partitions and aggregates results.
   - **Bindings:**
     C++ functionality is exposed to Python via pybind11 (located in ``src/cpp/bindings``).

2. **The Python Layer**
   Provides user-friendly wrappers, dataset loaders, and utility functions for integrating with PyTorch and other ML workflows. It is located in the ``src/python/`` directory and uses Sphinx (with autodoc) to extract docstrings from our Python code.


See the :doc:`architecture/architecture` for a detailed breakdown of the components and their interactions.

Contribution Workflow & Coding Standards
------------------------------------------
We expect all contributors to follow these practices:

Git Workflow & PRs
******************

- **Branching:** Create feature branches from the main branch.
- **Pull Requests:** Submit clear PRs with detailed descriptions and links to related issues.
- **Code Reviews:** Expect direct feedback—clarity and correctness are our top priorities.

Coding Standards
****************

- **C++:** Follow the `Google C++ Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_
- **Python:** Adhere to `PEP8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_
- **Docstrings & Comments:** Every class and function should be documented. Clear inline comments and comprehensive docstrings help both human readers and our automated documentation tools.

Testing
**********

- **C++ Tests:** Located in ``test/cpp/``; run them via CMake (e.g. using ``ctest`` or ``make quake_tests``).

- **Python Tests:** Located in ``test/python/``; run them with pytest.

- **When Adding Features:** Always add tests covering new functionality and ensure tests are clear and reflect real usage scenarios.

Workflow
--------------------------

1. **Clone and Set Up:**

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/marius-team/quake.git
   cd quake
   git submodule update --init --recursive

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout -b feature/my-feature

3. **Build and Activate Conda Environment:**

This installs the necessary dependencies for building Quake. See :doc:`install` for more details.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f environments/ubuntu-latest/conda.yaml
   conda activate quake-env

4. **Build the Code & Bindings:**

C++ Build (optional, if you only want to work on Python code):

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j$(nproc) bindings

Python Build

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .


5. **Run Tests:**

**C++ Tests:**

Build the tests and run them (assuming you are in the ``build/`` directory):

.. code-block:: bash

 make -j$(nproc) quake_tests
 test/cpp/quake_tests --gtest_filter=* # use filters to run specific tests

**Python Tests:**

Quake must be installed with pip to run the Python tests. Run them using pytest:

.. code-block:: bash

 pytest test/python/

6. **Make Changes and submit a PR:**

After making changes, commit them and push to your branch. Then, create a PR on the main branch.

Conclusion
----------
This guide is a living document. As Quake evolves, update it to reflect improvements and new practices. Our goal is to keep the codebase and its documentation clear, correct, and easy to contribute to.
